RTL design projects to showcase design skills, verilog language expertise and coding styles.
<pre>
1. Network Packet Decoder(Message Extractor):
   Problem statement : Design a verilog module to extract message payloads from a continuous stream of packets
   Pipelined design module reads input packet data from a FIFO and extracts messaged with variable lengths.
   Incorporates SRAM-based FIFO with pre-fetch buffer for packet storage.

2. FIFO:
   FIFO using True Dual Port Synchronous SRAM model.
   Configura
   Pre-fetch buffer to reduce read latency from 2 clocks to 1 clock for continuous reads.
